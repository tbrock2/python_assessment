Wheat analysis 

Analysis of this dataset was used to investigate which variety of wheat was likely to give the 
highest yield and should be recommended to farmers and plant breeders to be used over other 
varieties. Over 2 billion people rely on wheat as a source of calories and protein. Considering 
the global growing population, global warming and climate change, maximising yields of these 
essential crops is vital for food security and feeding the planet. 

The wheat dataset was downloaded from http://kaggle.com/datasets/jmcaro/wheat-seedsuci
The raw dataset has also been uploaded to the github repository as "seeds.csv" and "seeds_dataset.txt" formats.

The code for the analysis is called "seeds.ipynb" and is uploaded to git hub as a python 
jupyter notebook file. The only packages required to run the code are listed in the annotated 
code. 

To run the code:
1. open anaconda navigator and open the jupyter notebook file
2. install all packages before running them if they are not already installed on your computer (pip install package_name)
e.g.
 pip install pandas 
 import pandas as pd 
3. ensure you have downloaded the seeds.csv file first and then import the file. 

All packages used in this analysis:
pandas
seaborn
sklearn
matplotlib
numpy 
copy 
cv2

Comments in the code should help understanding of the analysis that has been carried out.
